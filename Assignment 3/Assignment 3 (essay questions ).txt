1. What is the Node.js Event Loop?
	The Event Loop is the core mechanism in Node.js that manages and executes asynchronous operations.
	It decides what should run now and what should wait and run later , it allows (non-blocking - Handle many requests - execute slow tasks in background )
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
2. What is Libuv and What Role Does It Play in Node.js?
	Libuv is a C library used by Node.js to handle asynchronous and non-blocking operations.
	Libuv solves this by: Running slow operations in the background - Using a thread pool - Returning the result to the Event Loop	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How Does Node.js Handle Asynchronous Operations Under the Hood?
	Node.js handles asynchronous operations using these components:
	Libuv (Thread Pool) => Executes heavy tasks in the background - use the thread pool - places completed callbacks into queue
	Event Loop and Queues => Continuously checks if the call stack is empty - moves ready callbacks from queue to the call stack then execute them in order
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What is the Difference Between the Call Stack, Event Queue, and Event Loop in Node.js?
	Call Stack => Execute Synchronous code - runs one operation at a time
	Event queue => stores callbacks of completed asynchronous operations - Tasks are ready to be executed but waiting
	Event Loop => Continuously checks if the call stack is empty - moves ready callbacks from queue to the call stack then execute them in order
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What is the Node.js Thread Pool and How to Set the Thread Pool Size?
	The Thread Pool in Node.js is: A group of background threads used to execute heavy operations
	Set the Thread Pool Size => UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. How Does Node.js Handle Blocking and Non-Blocking Code Execution?
	Node.js executes blocking code directly on the call stack 
	while non-blocking operations are handled asynchronously through Libuv and the Event Loop
